# Image Caption Generator
Image Caption Generation is a process of generating Textual Description of the Image that describe the Contents of the Image. This system follows an Encoder Decoder based Architecture where Encoder is used to encode the image i.e. extracting features from the Image and the Decoder is used to generate Descriptions or Captions from extracted Features of the Image. For Encoder part we generally use a Convolutional Neural Network for Extracting Features from the Image provided and for the Decoder part we use a Recurrent Neural Network for Generating Textual Data. It is a kind of a Multimodal Model where we are using two different kinds of Modalities which are Texts and Image. But by only using an CNN and RNN may not yield accurate results so we introduce Attention Mechanism which as the name suggests pays attention to Major part of the Data including Texts and Image and by paying attention to these different modalities helps the systems to understand the context of the Image and Text. By using Transfer Models like VGG16, Inception Resnet V2, Vision Transformers and other kinds of pre-trained models we can Extract important features from the Images including smallest details and by using RNN like Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) which uses Gating Mechanism to Generate more precise Texts.
